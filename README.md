# Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview
Predictive Maintenance System is a project that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict equipment failure based on sensor data. It collects and analyzes data such as temperature, vibration, and other relevant parameters to provide early warnings about potential failures.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Collects real-time data from IoT sensors (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses sensor data to remove noise and handle missing values.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses TensorFlow and other ML techniques for predictive analysis.
- **Failure Prediction:** Provides early detection of machinery failure to prevent downtime and reduce maintenance costs.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Displays insights and alerts for better decision-making.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **IoT & Sensors:** Data ingestion from connected devices
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance.git
   cd predictive-maintenance
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Connect your IoT sensors to the system.
2. Ensure data is being collected and stored properly.
3. Train the machine learning model using historical sensor data.
4. Deploy the model to predict failures in real-time.
5. Monitor system insights and alerts for proactive maintenance..
